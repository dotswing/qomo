    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        Qomo is a cloud platform for biological data storage, analysis and sharing.
        It integrates data and analysis tools in one stop;
        data is stored in a distributed manner and computations are run in parallel in multiple nodes.
        By adding more nodes into the cluster, it is capable of accommodating the growing needs of storage and computation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Qomo features <strong>modularized</strong> tools and <strong>customized</strong> pipelines.
        It includes a wide range of analysis tools and each tool is deployed as an individual module with compatible inputs and outputs.
        Users can develop new modules and add them to Qomo. Any pipeline in Qomo is composed of multiple modules.
        Accordingly, users can build customized pipelines based on a large collection of analysis modules.
        In addition, pipelines in Qomo can be made for public, facilitating pipeline reuse and sharing.
        As biological data is generated at ever-faster rates,
        Qomo bears the potential to effectively deal with big data storage, analysis, and sharing.
